# Release-V2

This one takes a bit of setup but overall is the best I currently have once completly setup. Due to it requiring each username and the corresponding user ID it can't really be used on large servers.
I'm working on a V3 to fix this issue but it's in a semi-working state and on hold as I complete finals.
